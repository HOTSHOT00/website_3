This island nation is home to a wide variety of flora and animals, from lush rainforests to dry plains. </br></br>The distinctive topography of the teardrop-shaped island, which includes coasts, wetlands, and mountains, adds to the remarkable diversity of habitats that are home to a wide range of species. The endemism of Sri Lanka's fauna is seen in the large number of species that are unique to our planet. </br></br>In national parks, majestic Asian elephants graze freely, and elusive leopards hunt through impenetrable woods. The rich wildlife, which includes uncommon indigenous species and brilliant kingfishers, fills the woods with a symphony of sounds. </br></br>The function of conservation initiatives is vital."
