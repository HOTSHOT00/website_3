                    <P class="leopard-para">One of the most famous and threatened species in Sri Lanka is the Sri Lankan
                        leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), a subspecies of the leopard that can only be found on the
                        island. The following are the main characteristics of the Sri Lankan leopard:</P>


                    </br></br>
                    <h3>Appearance:</h3>
                    The stunning coat of the Sri Lankan leopard, which ranges in color from pale yellow to tawny and
                    frequently has noticeable black rosettes and patches, is what makes it so unique. When compared to
                    leopards located in more humid environments, its fur is often shorter. </br></br>
                    <h3>Size:</h3>
                    Females are usually smaller, weighing between 29 and 64 kilograms (64 to 141 pounds), whereas adult
                    males normally weigh between 60 and 91 kilograms (132 to 200 pounds). Without the tail, its body
                    length varies from 4.3 to 6.2 feet.
                    </br></br>
                    <h3>Habitat:</h3>
                    The main habitats that these leopards live in are scrublands, rainforests, and dry evergreen
                    forests. Additionally, they can be found in Sri Lanka's central highlands, proving their resilience
                    to a variety of habitats.
                    </br></br>
                    <h3>Behavior:</h3>
                    Leopards in Sri Lanka tend to be solitary animals and are renowned for their elusiveness. They can
                    swim and climb with great skill, and they use these skills for hunting and environmental navigation.
                    They eat a wide range of prey, including as smaller animals, deer, and wild boar.
                    </br></br>
                    <h3>Conservation Status:</h3>
                    According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, the Sri Lankan
                    leopard is classified as Endangered. Loss of habitat, conflicts between humans and wildlife,
                    poaching, and the reduction of their prey base are among the threats to their survival. To lessen
                    these risks and save their ecosystems, conservation initiatives are being carried out.
                    </br></br>
                    <h3> Conservation Efforts::</h3>
                    Sri Lanka has created wildlife reserves and national parks to give leopards a safe haven.
                    Conservation efforts concentrate on research, community involvement, and putting policies in place
                    to lessen conflicts between leopards and nearby communities.
