                    <p class="section-description">Located in the southern region of Sri Lanka, Udawalawe National Park is a pristine sanctuary that is well-known for its varied fauna and stunning landscapes. The park, which covers an area of more than 30,000 hectares, was created mainly to safeguard the Udawalawe Reservoir and its watershed. For those who enjoy the outdoors and animals, the park is a sanctuary that provides a rare chance to see a variety of species in their native environments. Elephants are a major draw at Udawalawe, where groups can frequently be seen wandering freely across the expansive grasslands. A haven for birdwatchers, the park is home to an amazing array of creatures besides elephants, such as spotted deer, water buffalo, wild boar, and many bird species.</p> -->

                            <p class="table-dis-para">The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) is a fascinating and distinctive
                                species of bear native to the Indian subcontinent.Known for its shaggy, coarse fur and a
                                distinct white V-shaped mark on its chest, the sloth bear is easily identifiable.
                                Despite its name, the sloth bear is not related to sloths but earned its title due to
                                its slow and deliberate movements. These solitary creatures primarily inhabit forests,
                                grasslands, and scrublands, where they feed on a diverse diet that includes insects,
                                fruits, and occasionally small mammals. One remarkable feature of sloth bears is their
                                long, curved claws, which they use for digging and extracting termites and insects from
                                mounds. Unfortunately, sloth bears face various threats, including habitat loss and
                                human-wildlife conflict, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>

                                subspecies of the axis deer that is unique to the island of Sri Lanka. This type of
                                deer, which is distinguished by its characteristic reddish-brown coat with white
                                patches, is an important part of the island's ecology. The spotted deer, which usually
                                live in Sri Lanka's verdant forests and grasslands, frequently gathers in small herds
                                under the leadership of a dominant male. It is especially clear how graceful and nimble
                                these deer are while they are moving through their natural environment. The preservation
                                of the natural equilibrium of the island's varied ecosystems depends on the survival of
                                the Sri Lankan spotted deer, underscoring the significance of initiatives to save and
